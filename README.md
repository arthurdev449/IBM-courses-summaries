# IBM-courses-summaries for IBM Applied AI Developer Professional Certificate - Notes and Exercises

This repository contains my personal notes, code examples, exercise solutions, and project work from the IBM Applied AI Developer Professional Certificate program on Coursera.  It serves as a learning journal and a reference for the concepts and skills covered in the courses.

## About the Certificate

The IBM Applied AI Developer Professional Certificate is a series of courses designed to equip learners with the skills to build and deploy AI-powered applications.  It covers a range of topics, from Python fundamentals to generative AI, with a focus on practical application development.

## Courses Covered (and Progress)

This repository currently includes notes and exercises from the following courses within the certificate:

*   **[✓] Python Basics for Data Science**: Completed. nothing made yet
*   **[✓] Python for AI & Development Project:** compleating. Includes notes.
*   **[ ] Developing Generative AI Applications with Python:**  (Next in line)
*   **[ ] Introduction to Generative AI**
*   **[ ] Introduction to Prompt Engineering**
*   **[ ] AI for Everyone: Master the Basics**
*   **[ ] Introduction to Web Development with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.**

The `[✓]` indicates a completed course, and `[ ]` indicates a course that is planned or in progress.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by course.  Each course has its own directory, containing:

*   **`notes`:** Markdown files with detailed notes from each module of the course.  These notes have been refined and expanded with the help of an AI assistant for clarity and completeness. (will be changed to folder with md files instead)
*   **`exercises/`:**  A directory containing code examples, solutions to practice exercises, and any project work from the course.  This includes both in-course exercises and custom-designed exercises for additional practice. (will be added)
*   **`README.md`:**  A course-specific README file (within each course directory) providing more details about the course content and the materials in that directory. (will be added)

## How to Use This Repository

*   **Review Notes:** Browse the `notes/` directories to review the concepts covered in each course. The Markdown files are formatted for easy reading.
*   **Practice with Exercises:**  Examine the code in the `exercises/` directories to see examples of how the concepts are applied. You can copy and run this code in your own Python environment (e.g., Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook, a local Python installation).
*   **Understand the Course Structure:** Use the course-specific README files (`README.md` within each course directory) to get an overview of the course content.
*   **Learning Path:**  The order of the courses in the "Courses Covered" section reflects the recommended learning path for the certificate.

## Tools and Technologies

The primary tools and technologies used in these courses (and reflected in the notes and exercises) include:

*   **Python:** The core programming language.
*   **Pandas:**  A library for data analysis and manipulation.
*   **NumPy:**  A library for numerical computation.
*   **Requests:** A library for making HTTP requests (for interacting with APIs).
*   **Beautiful Soup:**  A library for web scraping (parsing HTML and XML).
*   **Flask:** A microframework for building web applications and APIs.
*   **unittest:** Python's built-in unit testing framework.
*   **IBM Watson AI services:** (Likely to be covered in later courses)
*   **Google Colab:** The primary environment i used for running the code examples and exercises. (utilize online gdb for unittest because colab doesen't have the library)

These notes and exercises represent my personal understanding of the course material.  While I've strived for accuracy and completeness, they are not a substitute for the official course content.
